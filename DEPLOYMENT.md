# Deployment Instructions - Proxy Solution

## Problem Solved: Mixed Content Error with HTTP Backend

Since your backend API only supports HTTP (free hosting limitation), this solution uses **Next.js API routes as a proxy** to avoid mixed content errors.

## How It Works

1. **Frontend (HTTPS)** â†’ **Next.js API Routes (HTTPS)** â†’ **Your Backend (HTTP)**
2. Browser only sees HTTPS requests (no mixed content error)
3. Next.js server handles HTTP communication with your backend

## Files Created

### API Proxy Routes
- `/app/api/auth/login/route.js` - Login proxy
- `/app/api/auth/register-teacher/route.js` - Teacher registration proxy  
- `/app/api/auth/register-student/route.js` - Student registration proxy
- `/app/api/proxy/[...path]/route.js` - General API proxy for all other endpoints

### Updated Files

- `AuthContext.js` - Now uses proxy endpoints (`/api/auth/*`, `/api/proxy/*`)
- `.env.local` - Simplified (no longer needs API URL)

## Deployment Steps

### No Environment Variables Needed! ðŸŽ‰

Unlike the previous solution, **no environment variables are required** because:
- API endpoints are now internal (`/api/*`)
- Backend URL is hardcoded in server-side proxy files
- No client-side API calls to external HTTP endpoints

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push your code** to GitHub
2. **Deploy to Vercel** (no additional configuration needed)
3. **Test the deployment** - mixed content error should be resolved

## How to Test

### Local Testing

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try logging in at `http://localhost:3000/login`
3. Check Network tab - all requests should go to `/api/*`

### Production Testing

1. After deployment, visit your Vercel URL
2. Try logging in
3. Check Network tab - all requests should be HTTPS to `/api/*`
4. No mixed content warnings in console

## Backend Communication

Your proxy routes handle communication with `http://eduscribe.runasp.net/api`:

- **Client** â†” **Next.js API** (HTTPS) âœ…
- **Next.js API** â†” **Your Backend** (HTTP) âœ…

This approach works because:
- Server-to-server HTTP calls are allowed
- Only browser-to-server HTTP calls are blocked (mixed content)

## Advantages of This Solution

âœ… **No backend changes required**
âœ… **No environment variables needed**  
âœ… **Works with free HTTP-only hosting**
âœ… **Fully secure HTTPS frontend**
âœ… **No mixed content errors**
